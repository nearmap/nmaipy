# Damage Classification Test Results

This directory contains geospatial output files from damage classification tests that are intended to be checked into version control for visual comparison and regression testing.

## Files

### `test_area_boundary.geojson`
- The 900x900m test area boundary in Houston affected by Hurricane Beryl (July 2024)
- Center coordinates: -95.786018, 29.554317
- Used as the AOI for damage classification tests

### `beryl_damage_classification_test.gpkg`
- GeoPackage file containing damage classification results from the test
- Generated by `test_damage_classification.py::test_damage_classification_basic`
- Contains building lifecycle features with damage attributes
- Includes extracted damage classification fields for easier viewing in QGIS:
  - `damage_class`: The highest confidence damage classification
  - `damage_confidence`: Confidence value for the primary classification
  - `undamaged_conf`, `affected_conf`, `minor_conf`, `major_conf`, `destroyed_conf`: Individual confidence values for each damage class
  - `survey_date`: Date of the survey
  - `postcat`: Whether this is post-catastrophe data

## Usage

These files can be opened in QGIS or other GIS software for visual inspection. When the damage classification API changes or is updated, running the tests will regenerate these files, allowing for easy comparison of results.

To view in QGIS:
1. Open QGIS
2. Add the `test_area_boundary.geojson` as a vector layer for reference
3. Add the `beryl_damage_classification_test.gpkg` layer
4. Style the damage features by `damage_class` or confidence values
5. Compare with previous versions using git diff or by checking out different commits

## Test Data

The test uses data from Hurricane Beryl's impact on Houston:
- Date range: 2024-07-08 to 2024-07-11
- Location: Houston, Texas
- Event: Hurricane Beryl damage assessment
- Expected features: Building lifecycle features with structural damage assessments
